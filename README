u5000, an alternative implementation of the network installation protocol used
by Mikrotik routers and switches.

Device discovery

  u5000/discovery \
    --interface ens3 \
    --timespan 10

  Listens for beacons sent out by Mikrotik devices that have successfully
  entered the network installation mode. Each beacon carries information about
  the device (model, platform, version) and is sent out in 1s intervals.

  This utility collects incoming beacons over the timespan interval. It then
  produces a list of discovered devices.

Firmware installation

  u5000/installer \
    --interface ens3 \
    --addresss 192.168.90.1 \
    --device de:ad:be:ef:c0:de \
    --blocksize 1000 \
      files/routeros-7.2.1-mipsbe.npk

  Pushes the specified files (NPK packages, autorun scripts) into the Mikrotik
  device identified by the MAC address.
