The netinstall executable is not bundled with this package. You may, however,
acquire them from Mikrotik at https://mikrotik.com/download or directly by
invoking the following commands. The netinstall package archive must be
decompressed first. The extraction script only works with the executable.

The following sequence of commands downloads the archive, decompresses it 
and extracts the boot images. The files are downloaded and extracted in the 
usual temporary directory (the /tmp directory) used on Linux platforms.

  wget -O /tmp/netinstall.zip \
    https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/7.2.3/netinstall-7.2.3.zip

  unzip -d /tmp \
    /tmp/netinstall.zip

  bash ./extract \
    /tmp/netinstall.exe /tmp
